## Rewinding a 3-Phase Squirrel Cage Induction Motor

**Objective**:  
Rewind the motorâ€™s stator coils to restore functionality, maintaining correct coil turns and phase alignments to create a 4-pole rotating magnetic field for torque generation.  

**Process**:  
- Disassembled the motor and removed old windings.  
- Insulated the stator slots and manually wound coils with precise slot placements.  
- Connected coils in a Wye configuration and reassembled the motor.  

**Output**:  
- The rewinded motor performed well in laboratory tests, providing a cost-effective solution at **2330 BDT**, compared to **8000 BDT** for a new motor.  

**Challenges and Solutions**:  
- Addressed issues like unequal coil turns and air gaps.  
- Overcame reduced efficiency due to thinner wires through manual adjustments.  

**Impact**:  
This project promotes recycling and reduces waste. It provides practical insights into motor construction and offers a sustainable, affordable alternative to purchasing new motors.
